# U.S. vs Washington State: Trends and County-Level Analysis of Electric Vehicle Adoption

This is a group data analysis project for **BA780 (Introduction to Data Analytics)**, Fall 2025.  
**Members:** Inchara Ashok, Charlotte Wang, Riya Poojary, Sambisha Godi, Sanskruti Pradeep Pawar, and myself.

---

## Overview
This project analyzes **electric vehicle (EV) adoption trends** in **Washington State** compared to the **United States**, focusing on **county-level adoption**, **policy influence**, and **market composition**.  
The analysis uses data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization to uncover insights about **BEV vs PHEV growth**, **CAFV eligibility**, and **utility coverage**.

---

## Key Findings
- Washington leads the U.S. in EV adoption but shows **urban–rural disparities**.  
- **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)** are growing faster than plug-in hybrids (PHEVs).  
- **Tesla, Nissan, and Chevrolet** dominate Washington’s EV market.  
- **CAFV incentives** have accelerated BEV adoption.  
- Expanding rural infrastructure is essential for meeting **2030 EV goals**.
